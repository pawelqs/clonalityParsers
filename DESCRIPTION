Title: R package for parsing SNV and CNV calls for clonality analysis
Version: 1.1.1
Author: Pawel Kus
Maintainer: Pawel Kus <pawel.s.kus@protonmail.com>
Description: Clonality analysis requires providing SNV and CNV calls to the clonality analysis
    algorithm. Since there is a number of CNV and SNV callers and at least the same number of
    clonality analysis alorithms, there might be tens of parsing combinations required.    
    This package is a container for functions parsing SNVs and CNVs to a kind of *universal* format,
    and for functions parsing the *universally* formated data to the format required by 
    clonality algorithms, to facilitate interchangeability of the algorithms.
